# Flood-Detection
Flood Detection using ANN on Malaysia Flood Dataset (2000 - 2010).

## Introduction
To detect flood based on rainfalls using deep learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) / Feedforward NN. This model has been used in my final year project called "Flood Monitoring and Alert System" to enhance predictive modelling for more precise flood forecasts, enabling proactive measures to be taken.

## System Design
